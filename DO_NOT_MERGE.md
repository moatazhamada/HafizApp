# DO NOT MERGE THIS BRANCH

This branch is a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) reimplementation and ongoing design-parity work-in-progress for the Hafiz app.

It is not intended to be merged into `master` yet. Please use it only for testing, review, and iteration.

Reasons:
- Active UI parity work vs. Flutter master
- Pending iOS asset bundling and preferences
- Pending full localization coverage and settings/about polish

Once parity is complete and vetted, we can revisit merge plans.
